# Algorithms 

Various types of algorithms can be found in the project. I divided them into two types: (i) related to sorting, (ii) related to graphs.

**Sorting algorithms**

I used data from Blum Blum Shub. Blum Blum Shub is a Pseudo Random Number Generator.
    
    a) selection sort
    
    b) bubble sort
    
    c) quick sort

**Graph algorithms**

    a) Dijkstra algorithm
    
    b) Depth-First Search - iterative and recursive
    
    c) Breadth-First Search - iterative and recursive
